        <h2>Deadpool</h2>
        <p>"Deadpool" follows Wade Wilson, a former special forces operative turned wisecracking mercenary. Diagnosed
          with terminal cancer, he undergoes a rogue experiment, leaving him with accelerated healing powers but a
          disfigured appearance. Adopting the alter ego Deadpool, he seeks revenge on the man who subjected him to the
          experiment. The film blends intense action with irreverent humor as Deadpool breaks the fourth wall,
          addressing the audience directly. His journey involves complex relationships, including a romance with Vanessa
          Carlysle. Full of pop culture references and meta-humor, "Deadpool" is celebrated for its unique take on the
          superhero genre, embracing R-rated content and providing a refreshing, unconventional narrative.</p>

        <h2>The Umbrella Academy</h2>
        <p>The Umbrella Academy is set in a universe where 43 women around the world gave birth simultaneously at noon
          on October 1, 1989, although none had shown any sign of pregnancy until labor began. Seven of the children are
          adopted by eccentric billionaire Sir Reginald Hargreeves and turned into a superhero team that he calls "The
          Umbrella Academy." Hargreeves gives the children numbers rather than names, but their robot-mother, Grace,
          later names six of them: Luther, Diego, Allison, Klaus, Ben, and Vanya.[1] Reginald puts six of the children
          to work fighting crime but keeps Vanya apart from her siblings' activities, claiming she demonstrates no
          powers of her own.</p>
